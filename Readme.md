# 🧑‍⚖️ Online Judge

**Online Judge** is a full-stack web application built to simulate competitive programming platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and HackerRank. It allows users to view problems, write and submit code in multiple languages, and get real-time verdicts.

> ⚠️ This project is currently under development. More features and polish are being added continuously.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Code Execution:** Docker (for safe, isolated evaluation)

---

## 🎯 Key Features (Planned & In Progress)

- ✅ User Registration and Login  
- ✅ Problem listing and detailed view  
- ✅ Code submission in **C++, Java, Python**  
- ✅ Verdicts like Accepted, WA, TLE, etc.  
- ✅ User Profile with submission history  
- 🛠️ Admin panel for problem management (coming soon)  
- 🏆 Leaderboard and contest system (coming soon)

## 📄 Pages

- `/` – Homepage  
- `/login` – User login  
- `/register` – New user signup  
- `/problems` – Problem list  
- `/problems/:id` – Problem detail + code editor  
- `/submissions` – View recent submissions  
- `/profile` – User dashboard (planned)

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. User selects a problem
2. Writes code in the built-in editor
3. Submits code → Backend sends it to a Docker container
4. Code is compiled and run against hidden test cases
5. Verdict is returned and stored

## 📦 Status

This is a **college project** aimed at learning and building a working prototype of a coding platform.  
The initial version focuses on individual problem solving — contests and scaling features will be added next.
